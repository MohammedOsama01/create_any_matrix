# Java 2D Array Example

This Java project demonstrates the use of 2D arrays. It allows the user to input a 2D array of a specified size, finds the minimum value in the array along with its position, calculates the sum for each row and column, and returns the indices of the minimum element.

## Requirements
- Java JDK
- A compatible IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VSCode)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

## Instructions
1. Run the program, and it will prompt you to enter the size of rows and columns for the 2D array.
2. Next, enter the values for each element in the array.
3. The program will display the input 2D array.
4. It will find and print the minimum value in the array along with its row and column indices.
5. The program will then calculate and print the sum for each row in the 2D array.
6. Finally, it will calculate and print the sum for each column in the 2D array.
